# arcpy_batch_mapping
This repository is about arcpy batch mapping scripts I have created.

You can download this program "arcpyplot.py", and use "from arcpyplot import ArcpyPlot" to use this script or derictly edit this .py file.
what issues script named "arcpyplot.py" aimes at are these mapping problems that can be batch processed by replacing layers or rewriting attribute table of layer.
